>It was just a typical day in the bakery for Delphine. She was preparing her famous chocolate cake, when all of a sudden a GIANt burst through the doors of her >establishment and demanded a cookie. Being the strong-willed girl she was, Delphine refused and promptly threw her rolling pin at the GIANt. Doing what any sensible >being would do when faced with projectiles, the GIANt let out a shriek and ran out of the shop. Delphine smiled to herself, it was another day well done.
