**Challenge Name:** <br/>
That's Some Interesting Tea(rs).......

**Points:** <br/>
175

**Description:** <br/>

You know, the tears of one's enemies works lovely in tea. Turns out, there's tons of different bases for tea. In fact, I think I heard Delphine talk about this chef website she used for her tea base combinations. . .

Oh! Speaking of which, GIANt wants Delphine to make him tea. . . all he has is the tea leaves and the cup though. Maybe you can help Delphine, since she's really busy with cooking other things?
