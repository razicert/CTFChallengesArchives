**Description:** <br/>

It appears that my cat has gotten itself stuck in a tree... It's really tall and I can't seem to reach it. Maybe you can throw a snake at the tree to find it?

Oh, you want to know what my cat looks like? I put a picture in the hints.



**Hint:** <br/>
Here, my cat looks like this:
#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E #FFC90E#000000#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF #FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF #FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF #FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF #FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF



**Solution:** <br/>
Inside the ZIP file there are many nested folders and files. We can search for pictures first and copy them to a new folder. When using a program like fdupes or a python script to remove duplicate files. After that we have only 3 files. One of them is the flag.

Flag: `rtcp{meow_sharp_pidgion_rice_tree}`
